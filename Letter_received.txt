Hi [name],

I hope you and your love ones are doing well during this unprecedented times. I'm truly sorry for the delaying of my messages regarding the status of your assignments until now.
I'm still in the beta version of the program so there might be some bugs to fix.

This is an automated message giving confirmation that I received your assignment for week 11. For the rest of the term I will notify you using this system.
Please don't reply to this message unless there's an issue with the assignment described in the subject of this email. Answering some questions:

If I didn't receive the first part of your tutorial 7 or if you sent it after due date I cannot change your scores.
Please make sure to send me a valid (readable) version of your tutorials before Fridays at 4 pm. I'll make exceptions to account for these times but if your assignment looks too similar to my answer key I'll deliver a zero.

******IMPORTANT******
I have identified the use of course hero, yahoo answers and copies of tutorials from past years that were used in the quiz 10 and 11 delivered to me by many of you. I emailed directly to some of you about the seriousness of this misconduct, which gets agravated by the vulnerability of the marking process produced as a response to COVID-19.
As your TA my responsibilities demand to communicate with the instructor about any mischievous behavior and with you about the consequences. The instructor is authorized to invoke any of the measures stated in the Disciplinary measures section of the Vancouver Academic Calendar (http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960) that can have serious consequences for the student.

I have received the indication by Craig to leave your mark as zero if I perceive any evidence of misconduct (point 2 in the aforementioned link). Any dispute will therefore be communicated directly to the main instructor, to whom I'll be in responsibility to provide any supporting documentation that he might require.

For details on what represents academic misconduct, please refer to the following link: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/?tree=3,54,111,959
